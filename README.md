# Cook Nook (A digital cook book for your own little nook of the world)
link: https://cooknook.herokuapp.com/recipes/

## Project Description
A recipe book that lets users enter in their favorite recipes. The app will allow user to add new recipes including their incgridients, directions, and other miscellaneous information about that recipe. Recipes will be listed out with different categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc... Recipes will also have sub-categories letting the user enter in custom tags such as quick, easy, one pot, or whatever they want! The main goal for the app is to let the user have their very own little custom digital recipe book where they can have a list of all of their personal recipes to choose from when they just cant decide instead of trying to find a recipe online and sift through ads and a mundane backstory about the recipe.
